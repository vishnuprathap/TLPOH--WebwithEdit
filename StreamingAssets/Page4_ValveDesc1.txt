Operating parts (normally unprotected), remain in the flow stream.
Create Turbulence in flow leads to wear.
Sealing Surfaces in flow stream.
Sealing Surfaces do not self clean, (Particles are entrapped).

Valves for dirty fluid and slurry applications should meet these design criteria:

It is preferable that they are full bore, The valve “member” be it gate, disc or ball should not be in the flow path in the open position to reduce wear. There should be no cavities for product to deposit and possibly hamper closure.
