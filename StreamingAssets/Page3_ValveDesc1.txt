The knife gate was light weight compared to standard gate valves, had a cutting action with the knife edge blade to cut through fibrous materials.

A knife gate consists of a blade, body and operating mechanism. There are variations of seat design from integral metal seats. push through sleeves and engineered combination seats.

A knife gate is an isolation valve in its basic form and not generally used for control. Knife gate valves are generally used for isolation of dirty fluids or slurries. Dependent on the design type, this maybe dirty water for unidirectional commodity design through to 60% solid slurries for push through or shear gate design.
